This is a practice project that I'm using to learn how to automate stuff in the browser with Selenium Webdriver. This is a node project that takes a search from the user and tries to find a page on Wikipedia.

If you want to try it out, make sure to have have Node installed, then run `node index.js`. It will ask you what you want to search for. Just type your search (doesn't need quotes around it), then hit enter. Note, you also need to have the [Firefox driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/) (since it's the only supported browser).
